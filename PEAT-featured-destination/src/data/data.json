Beginning in 2022, the city will restrict vacation rentals to the tourist core, the area along US-50 between the state line and Ski Run Boulevard. While the city of South Lake Tahoe has ceased granting short-term rental permits, homes in El Dorado County may still receive them. Currently, the <a href=\"https://www.cdtfa.ca.gov/taxes-and-fees/rates.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">tax rate for vacation rentals in South Lake Tahoe is 10 percent, with a nightly rate of 4.5 percent</a>.</p>\r\n<p>With such new regulations to consider, it pays to have a local vacation rental manager on your side. Our local teams look after your home, your guests, and your community to make renting as stress free as possible. We require an in-person check-in at our office to ensure our guests know about the rules and regulations that both the city and county have in place.</p>\r\n<p>We clean your home before and after every guest stay, restock toiletries, and even respond to guest-related emergencies 24/7. When you want to get away and visit your South Lake Tahoe vacation home, rest assured that it'll be ready for you anytime.</p>\r\n<p>We aim to make your vacation rental profitable, too. We'll take professional photographs, list your home on sites like Airbnb and TripAdvisor, and manage your bookings to get you the best exposure possible. Your home's nightly rate automatically adjusts to changes in season and demand to garner the highest nightly prices during the peak season, while driving bookings when tourism slows down. Your home will look good and remain competitively-priced, earning you more all year long.</p>\r\n<p>Talk to a local expert about opportunities to rent your South Lake Tahoe-area vacation home. We'll make it simple to earn more and rent with ease.</p>",
